# Sentiment Analysis on Large Scale Amazon Product Reviews

## Background
In the contemporary landscape of e-commerce, consumer decisions are increasingly shaped by online reviews. This project, titled "Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Product Reviews," was presented at the IEEE International Conference on Innovative Research and Development in May 2018, Bangkok, Thailand. The project is authored by Tanjim Ul Haque, Nudrat Nawal Saber, and Faisal Muhammad Shah.

## Introduction
The project aims to explore sentiment analysis methodologies to decode sentiments embedded within extensive Amazon product review datasets.

## Model Used and Algorithms
### Objective
Develop a supervised learning model for sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews.
### Specific Goals
Achieve accuracy exceeding 90% in sentiment classification.
Explore and implement feature extraction methods such as Bag of Words, TFIDF, and Chi Square.
Compare and evaluate various classifiers, including Linear Support Vector Machine, Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree.

## Methodology
Active Learning Approach: Implement a pool-based active learning process for iterative dataset labeling, utilizing user feedback to enhance model accuracy.
Feature Extraction Methods: Employ Bag of Words approach focusing on nouns and adjectives, apply TF-IDF and Chi Square methods for effective feature extraction.

## Evaluation
Classifier Comparison: Evaluate the performance of multiple machine learning algorithms through 10-fold cross-validation, analyzing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Comparative Analysis: Compare the proposed model's accuracy with related works in sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews.
