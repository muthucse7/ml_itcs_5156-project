# Project: Sentiment Analysis on Large Scale Amazon Product Reviews

## Abstract
- E-commerce is booming, emphasizing the importance of online reviews.
- Sentiment analysis helps understand customer sentiments towards products.
- Supervised learning on large-scale Amazon datasets achieved satisfactory accuracy.

## Introduction
- Online commerce relies heavily on customer reviews for product selection.
- Importance of sentiment analysis for understanding product popularity.
- Objective: Categorize positive/negative feedback using supervised learning.
- Trust in reviews: Over 88% of online shoppers trust reviews as much as personal recommendations.

## Related Works
- Various approaches in sentiment analysis and opinion mining.
- Examples: Business analytics, probabilistic machine learning, feature selection methods.
- Active learning, feature extraction techniques, and different classifiers used in previous studies.

## Methodology
- Utilized Amazon product data for analysis.
- Data Acquisition: Three categories selected – Electronics, Cell Phones, Musical Instruments.
- Active learning approach for data labelling.
- Data Pre-Processing: Tokenization, stop words removal, POS tagging.
- Feature Extraction: Bag of Words, TF-IDF, Chi-Square.
- Evaluation Measures: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score.

## Results
- Experimented with various machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest).
- Achieved high accuracies ranging from 88% to 94% across different datasets.
- SVM consistently provided the highest accuracy.

## Comparative Analysis
- Compared project results with previous related works.
- Achieved significantly higher accuracies compared to earlier studies.
- Improved methodologies in pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification.

## Conclusion and Future Works
- Proposed supervised learning model demonstrated effectiveness.
- Achieved over 90% accuracy in sentiment analysis.
- Future works include automation of data labelling, integration with customer interaction systems, and generalization to diverse text-based reviews.
